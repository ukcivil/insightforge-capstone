#  InsightForge ‚Äì AI-Powered Business Intelligence Assistant

**InsightForge** is a tool built with **Streamlit** that allows the user to explore provided sales data in CSV format using **AI**. It uses **ChatGPT (GPT-3.5)** and **LangChain** to answer questions, create summaries, and generate charts (where relevant) ‚Äî all from the provided CSV file uploaded into the interface.  The tool also provides a log of questions and answers that can be easily downloaded from within the app to show previous questions and answers.

You can ask questions like:
- ‚ÄúHow are sales trending over time?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhich product performs best?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the average customer satisfaction by region?‚Äù

##  What This App Can Do

- Upload a provided sales CSV file
- Ask questions about the data in English
- Get helpful answers powered by AI and other tools
- See useful charts when relevant
- Download a log of your questions and answers

## üöÄ How This App Was Built and Deployed

### üß™ Step 1: Developed in Google Colab

The project started as a Jupyter-style notebook in Google Colab. This allowed quick testing of:
- Data loading and transformation using `pandas`
- Summarizing insights with Python
- Connecting to OpenAI's GPT model through LangChain
- Creating sample visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Step 2: Moved to GitHub for Version Control

After testing, the code was moved into a standalone script (`app.py`) and pushed to a GitHub repository. This made it easy to:
- Organize files (data, scripts, logs)
- Track changes over time
- Connect with external tools like Streamlit

---

### üåê Step 3: Deployed with Streamlit Cloud

To make the app usable by anyone:
1. The GitHub repo was connected to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
2. Streamlit pulled the `app.py` file and required libraries from `requirements.txt`
3. The app was deployed as a live website

This process made it possible to share the project as a web app where users can:
- Upload a CSV
- Ask questions
- View smart insights and charts instantly
